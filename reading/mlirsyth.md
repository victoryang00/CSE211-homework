# MLIRSynth: Automatic, Retargetable Program Raising in Multi-Level IR using Program Synthesis


1. **Motivation**:
   - Problem Statement
     - The current compilation phase for the heterogenous devices like CPU GPU or TPU is too divergence and not high performance because of the lack of semantic translation when lowering the IR.

     - MLIR is an infrastructure for developing domain-specific compilers. To aid this, MLIR provides reusable building blocks, especially the abstraction of dialects with a bunch of operator that has knowledge of cross device memory communication and predifined  and shared tools that allow us to define domain-specific languages and their compilation pipelines.
